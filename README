NAME
    Net::Riak - Interface to Riak

VERSION
    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
        my $client = Net::Riak->new(host => 'http://10.0.0.40:8098');
        my $bucket = $client->bucket('blog');
        my $obj    = $bucket->new_object('new_post', {title => 'foo', content => 'bar'});
        $obj->store;

        my $obj = $bucket->get('new_post');

DESCRIPTION
  ATTRIBUTES
    host
        URL of the node (default 'http://127.0.0.1:8098'). If your ring is
        composed with more than one node, you can configure the client to
        hit more than one host, instead of hitting always the same node. For
        this, you can do one of the following:

        all nodes equals
                my $riak = Net::Riak->new(
                    host => [
                        'http://10.0.0.40:8098',
                        'http://10.0.0.41:8098'
                    ]
                );

        give weight to nodes
                my $riak = Net::Riak->new(
                    host => [
                        {node => 'http://10.0.0.40:8098', weight => '0.2'},
                        {node => 'http://10.0.0.41:8098', weight => '0.8'}
                    ]
                );

        Now, when a request is made, a node is picked at random, according
        to weight.

    prefix
        Interface prefix (default 'riak')

    mapred_prefix
        MapReduce prefix (default 'mapred')

    r   R value setting for this client (default 2)

    w   W value setting for this client (default 2)

    dw  DW value setting for this client (default 2)

    client_id
        client_id for this client

  METHODS
METHODS
  bucket
        my $bucket = $client->bucket($name);

    Get the bucket by the specified name. Since buckets always exist, this
    will always return a Net::Riak::Bucket

  is_alive
        if (!$client->is_alive) {
            ...
        }

    Check if the Riak server for this client is alive

  add
        my $map_reduce = $client->add('bucket_name', 'key');

    Start assembling a Map/Reduce operation

  link
        my $map_reduce = $client->link();

    Start assembling a Map/Reduce operation

  map
        my $map_reduce = $client->add('bucket_name', 'key')->map("function ...");

    Start assembling a Map/Reduce operation

  reduce
        my $map_reduce = $client->add(..)->map(..)->reduce("function ...");

    Start assembling a Map/Reduce operation
